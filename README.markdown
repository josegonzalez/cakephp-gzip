# Gzip Component

Easily Gzip your production application's HTML output with the Gzip Component Plugin

## Background

I was attempting to optimize some small sites according to what YSlow said was inefficient, and saw some code at "debuggable.com":http://debuggable.com/posts/issues-with-output-buffering-in-cakephp:480f4dd5-b4fc-42a7-a5ab-4544cbdd56cb that mentioned gzipping html output. So I wrapped that into a method in the AppController and used it in Production.

Not happy with copy-pasting that one method each and every time, I refactored it into a Component (woo-hoo CakePHP Components!), which I've just now refactored as a plugin. Thats a lot of refactoring.

This plugin only works on HTML, so YMMV.

## Installation

_[Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)]_

Add the plugin to your project's `composer.json` - something like this:

    {
        "require": {
            "josegonzalez/cakephp-gzip": "dev-master"
        }
    }

Because this plugin has the type `cakephp-plugin` set in it's own `composer.json`, composer knows to install it inside your `/Plugins` directory, rather than in the usual vendors file. It is recommended that you add `/Plugins/Upload` to your .gitignore file. (Why? [read this](http://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).)

_[Manual]_

* Download this: [https://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-gzip/zipball/master](https://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-gzip/zipball/master)
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `app/Plugin`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `Gzip`

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:

    git submodule add git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-gzip.git Plugin/Gzip
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type

    git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-gzip.git Gzip

## Usage

# Include the component in your controller (AppController or otherwise)

```php
<?php
App::uses('Controller', 'Controller');
class AppController extends Controller {
    public $components = array('Gzip.Gzip');
}
?>
```

At this point, everything should theoretically work.

## Notes

Due to the way CakePHP does output buffering, this will only work when debug is less than 2.

## TODO:

- Gzip more than just HTML
- Other, configurable methods of compression
- Turn off compression via a url param or a secret url
